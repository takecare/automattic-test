## Your Task

*If you choose to accept it*: display the "Featured Image" for each post that has one within the list of posts in the app.

* Treat this as if you own the app, and you'll be releasing the finished product and source code under your own name.
* Keep in mind:
    * Android's [Code Style Guidelines for Contributors](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html)
    * i18n: every user visible string should be translatable.
    * Security, best practices, code documentation, etc.
* Don't be code-shy and feel free to explore other parts of the app, not only those you need to touch to solve your problem.
* Commit changes to the git repository that we provided to you, splitting up commits as necessary.
* Let us know when you're done with the test.
